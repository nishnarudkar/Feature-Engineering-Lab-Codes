# Feature Engineering Lab Codes

Welcome to the **Feature Engineering Lab Codes** repository!  
This repository contains all the practical experiments performed as part of the Feature Engineering Lab under the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (DY Patil University).

## 📋 List of Experiments

1. **To understand exploratory data analysis and practically implement various data preprocessing techniques**
2. **To implement a data analysis model using visualization**
3. **To apply feature transformation techniques like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding**
4. **To demonstrate how applying Min-Max scaling to input features affects the accuracy of a logistic regression classifier**
5. **To demonstrate the impact of standardization on logistic regression classifiers**
6. **To perform quantization and binning on the features of the given dataset and analyze their effect on feature representation**
7. **To implement PCA for dimensionality reduction on a dataset and analyze the explained variance**
8. **To extract numerical features from unstructured text using the Bag-of-Words**
9. **To implement the TF-IDF algorithm for feature extraction from unstructured text**
10. **To demonstrate the application of simple filters in Parkinson’s disease**
